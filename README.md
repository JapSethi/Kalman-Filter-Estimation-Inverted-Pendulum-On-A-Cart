# Kalman-Filter-Estimation-Inverted-Pendulum-On-A-Cart
Mini Side Project to check observability and do optimal linear full state estimation of Inverted Pendulum on a Cart

**To check observability and create an optimal linear full state feedback of an Inverted Pendulum on a Cart** 

#### Objectives Achieved: 

- Modeled MIMO dynamic systems using state-space techniques.
- Analytically and numerically solved for the dynamic response of any linear dynamic system and relate the response to the state-space system description.
- Analyzed the open-loop and closed-loop stability of any state-space representation.
- Designed linear state-feedback controllers using pole placement techniques.
